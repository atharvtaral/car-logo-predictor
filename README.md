# Advanced Hybrid Medical AI Assistant 🩺

A real-world, production-grade **Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** Medical Assistant engineered with an intelligent **Conditional Model Routing** pipeline. This system leverages advanced vision capabilities to parse handwritten medical prescriptions and seamlessly transitions between high-speed open-source execution and sophisticated multi-lingual processing.

## 🚀 Architectural Overview & Core Workflow

The system is architected to optimize infrastructure costs, response latency, and translation quality by orchestrating open-source and proprietary foundation models through **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**.

## 🔥 Key Technical Features

### 1. Dynamic Hybrid Model Routing & Cost Optimization

- **Contextual Routing:** Implemented dynamic execution trees via **LCEL**. English conversational inputs bypass commercial endpoints to run on high-performance infrastructure via **NVIDIA NIM** utilizing `meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct`.
- **Advanced Cross-Lingual Nuance:** Automatically routes Marathi requests to OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini`, resolving tokenization inefficiencies and preserving medical vocabulary syntax structures in regional semantics.

### 2. Multi-Modal Vision Processing Pipeline

- **Pillow Buffer Serialization:** Mitigated stream exceptions from non-standard desktop crop utilities (`image/x-png` format mutations) by implementing a strict **RGB-JPEG re-rendering engine** via `PIL.Image` and `io.BytesIO`.
- **Zero-Shot Clinical Classification:** Configured localized contextual prompts allowing the vision model to decipher non-standard Latin medical shorthand conventions (such as `G.`/`Gtt.` indicating _Guttae_ eye drops) to extract complex brand identities like _Azopt_, _Combigan_, and _Xalatan_.

### 3. Enterprise Cloud-Native RAG Pipeline

- **Deterministic Guardrails:** Prevented stochastically generated hallucinations by restricting domain response space strictly to an isolated knowledge corpus.
- **Vector Store Architecture:** Managed document embedding vectors through **Pinecone Serverless Vector Databases** synced using local HuggingFace feature-extraction pipelines (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` generating **384-dimensional dense tensors** matching cosine similarity profiles).

### 4. Stateful Session Memory Framework

- **Thread Isolation:** Wrapped active prompt chains inside a state-aware **RunnableWithMessageHistory** block.
- **Streamlit Core Lifecycle Sync:** Bound temporary conversational historical states to Streamlit's structural execution stack via `st.session_state.chat_store`, ensuring transactional execution memory retention across asymmetric layout re-renders.
